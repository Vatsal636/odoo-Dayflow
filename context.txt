I need you to act as a System Architect and Product Manager for a project called Dayflow - Human Resource Management System. Your goal is to design the logic and functional flow for a web application that streamlines core HR operations. The system must align daily work processes by providing secure, role-based access for two distinct user types: Employees and Admin/HR Officers.

Below is the complete context, module breakdown, and required data flow for the project. Please ensure all logical constraints and user permissions are strictly followed.

1. Project Overview & Scope
Project Name: Dayflow Tagline: Every workday, perfectly aligned.


Purpose: To digitize employee onboarding, profile management, attendance tracking, leave management, and payroll visibility. Core User Roles:


Admin / HR Officer: Has management privileges, approves requests, and manages payroll.
+1


Employee: Regular user with limited access to their own data and application features.
+1

2. Module Requirements
Module A: Authentication & Authorization
Sign Up:

The admins can create a new employee by adding their details, a employeeID is automatically generated and a password is generated and sent to the employee's email. The employee can then login using their email and password and a forced password change is mandatory. 

The Login ID should be automatically generated by the system in the following format: 
Example: OIJODO20220001

Explanation: 
OI → Odoo India (Company Name)
JODO → First two letters of the employee’s first name and last name
2022 → Year of Joining
0001 → Serial Number of Joining for that Year


Constraints: Passwords must follow security rules, and email verification is mandatory.

Sign In:

Access via Email and Password.


Logic: Incorrect credentials trigger an error; successful login redirects to the appropriate role-based dashboard.

Module B: Dashboard (Role-Based)

Employee Dashboard: Must display quick-access cards for Profile, Attendance, and Leave Requests, along with a logout option and recent activity alerts.


Admin/HR Dashboard: Must provide a high-level view of the Employee List, Attendance Records, and Leave Approvals, with the ability to switch views between different employees.
+2

Module C: Profile Management

View Access: Employees can view their Personal details, Job details, Salary structure, Documents, and Profile picture.
+1

Edit Access:


Employees: Can only edit limited fields: Address, Phone, and Profile Picture.


Admins: Have full permission to edit all employee details.

Module D: Attendance Management

Tracking: The system must track statuses including Present, Absent, Half-day, and Leave.


Actions: Employees need functionality to 'Check-in' and 'Check-out'.
+2


Visibility: Employees can view only their own attendance (Daily/Weekly views), while Admins can view attendance records for all employees.
+1

Module E: Leave & Time-Off Management
Application (Employee Side):

Inputs: Select Leave Type (Paid, Sick, Unpaid), choose Date Range, and add Remarks.

Initial Status: Pending.

Approval (Admin Side):

Admins view all pending requests.

Actions: Approve or Reject and add Comments.


Logic: Any status change (Approved/Rejected) must reflect immediately in the employee's record.
+1

Module F: Payroll/Salary Management

Employee Access: Read-only view of their own payroll data.


Admin Access: Full control to view payroll for all employees, update salary structures, and ensure payroll accuracy.
+1

3. Data Flow & Logic Scenarios
Scenario 1: Leave Request Lifecycle

Initiation: Employee submits a leave request with type "Sick Leave" and dates.


Processing: System saves request as "Pending" and notifies the Admin Dashboard.

Action: Admin reviews the request in the "Leave Approvals" list. Admin clicks "Approve" and adds a comment "Get well soon".


Completion: System updates status to "Approved" and logs the Time-Off in the Employee’s attendance record.
+1

Scenario 2: Attendance Tracking

Action: Employee logs in and clicks "Check-in".


Logic: System captures the timestamp and marks the daily status as "Present" (or "Half-day" based on duration).
+2


Visibility: This update is immediately visible on the Admin's "Attendance Records" view.

Scenario 3: Profile Updates

Constraint Check: Employee attempts to change "Job Details". System blocks action (Read-only).
+1

Allowed Action: Employee attempts to change "Phone Number". System allows update and saves changes.

Admin Override: Admin accesses the same profile and updates "Job Details" (Promoted). System saves changes.

Please use this context to generate the necessary artifacts (user stories, database schema, or UI wireframes) for the Dayflow system.

Apart from the above information, other things to be noted are that the tech stack for this will be NextJS, and proper middleware will be used to handle the authentication and authorization of the admins and employees. Proper coding standards will be followed and the code will be well-documented. Good UI/UX design will be followed and the application will be responsive and user-friendly. The color scheme will be White and shades of Blue. The database needs to be designed in such a way that it can be easily scaled and the application can be deployed on any cloud platform. The database to be used is posstgresql using prisma as the ORM. Javascript should be used to handle the logic, not TypeScript and the UI should be designed using NextJS.
